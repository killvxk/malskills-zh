  This skill should be used when the user asks about "shellcode-fluctuation",
  "implants are being detected by memory-scanning EDR products during sleep".
  C++ shellcode fluctuation technique that encrypts injected shellcode between
  C2 sleep intervals to evade EDR memory scans.

# Shellcode Fluctuation

C++ in-memory evasion — XOR-encrypts shellcode in RX pages during C2 sleep to defeat memory scanners.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build with MSVC
git clone https://github.com/mgeeky/ShellcodeFluctuation
# Open in Visual Studio, build Release x64

# Or MinGW
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O2 -o fluctuator.exe main.cpp -lntdll
```

## Core Mechanism

```
[Shellcode in memory]
  Awake:  → Decrypt → Execute → Sleep
  Asleep: → Encrypt (XOR) → change PROT to RW → Scanner sees garbage
  Wake:   → change PROT to RX → Decrypt → Resume
```

## Configuration (main.cpp)

```cpp
#define SHELLCODE_FLUCTUATE   true
#define XOR_KEY               0xdeadbeef
#define SLEEP_INTERVAL_MS     5000
```

## Common Workflows

**Integrate into Cobalt Strike BOF loader:**
1. Generate raw shellcode from CS listener
2. Embed in fluctuator loader source
3. Call `FluctuateShellcode()` wrapper before Sleep()

**Combine with indirect syscalls:**
```cpp
// Replace VirtualProtect with direct NtProtectVirtualMemory
// via syscall stub to avoid API hooks
```
